# Full-Stack Book Store Project
This is a full-stack web application for managing a bookstore. It features a front-end interface, a back-end server, and a database to store and manage book data. The goal of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of how the front-end interacts with the back-end server via HTTP requests and how to efficiently manage data within a MySQL database. It showcases the use of the RESTful API to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing book entries, which include details such as the book's title, genre, publication date, and ISBN.
